### Quantum Harmonic Osciallator

A QHO is a simple system that can be solved exactly, one of the few in quantum mechanics.

The Hamiltonian for a QHO is given by:

$$
\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2\hat{x}^2
$$

where $\hat{p}$ is the momentum operator, $\hat{x}$ is the position operator, $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the oscillator.

### Schwarzschild Radius Calculator

The Schwarzschild radius is the radius of a sphere such that, if all the mass of an object were to be compressed within that sphere, the escape velocity from the surface of the sphere would equal the speed of light.

The Schwarzschild radius is given by:

$$
r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
$$

where $r_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius, $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ is the mass of the object, and $c$ is the speed of light.
